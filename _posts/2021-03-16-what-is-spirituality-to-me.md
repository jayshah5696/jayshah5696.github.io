This is my first article on my page, and I think writing about spirituality is the best way I can start this journey.

My journey to knowing the unknown started 3 years back where I find myself engrossed in videos of Sadhguruji. This is where it all started. I could not stop myself from watching him. He talked about all the things that affect our lives with such great clarity and perception. It opened up a whole new world within me. 

I learned a lot about myself in this journey. I am doing meditation for the past 3 years and I can only say that it has helped me immensely. I can not think about my life without it. I can only say that I am not the same person that I used to be. It changed me from my core. 

And now I can say that, Whatever I do, whatever I am going to do is just with intention of serving.  I am forever in debt to my guru Sadhguruji.
