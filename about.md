I'm an enthusiast and a self-taught Data Scientist/Machine Learning Engineer. With the habit of logical thinking and my nature as a constant explorer, I'm always trying to ask the appropriate question to look deep into the problem.


My dream is to stimulate innovation based manufacturing of technology and services easily accessible to those in need. I intend to achieve the same by leveraging data to improvising or optimizing the system that is easily accessible to all.
