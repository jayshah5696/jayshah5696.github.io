## My Journey in Data Science and AI

With over six years of experience in the field, I'm passionate about using data and AI to create a better, more sustainable future. I thrive in environments that value innovation and progress, and I find immense satisfaction in tackling complex challenges and transforming them into impactful solutions.

Currently, I'm leading the AI efforts at [SparkCognition](https://sparkcognition.com), developing and deploying cutting-edge AI solutions that leverage the power of Large Language Models (LLMs). We're revolutionizing industries like renewable energy, where our AI-powered predictive maintenance systems are increasing efficiency and reliability, saving companies millions. I'm also deeply involved in building robust data pipelines that democratize access to data and AI, making these powerful tools accessible to everyone.

Before SparkCognition, I developed my skills at Texas A\&M University, researching machine learning to predict wind energy problems. I also gained experience at Utilities and Energy Services, creating models to track energy use based on weather.

I'm passionate about using AI for positive change. My goal is to build AI solutions that make the world better, especially in areas like sustainability. I was a Data Ambassador at DataKind, where I volunteered my time to help nonprofits leverage data science for social good.

I'm eager to connect with others passionate about data and AI. Let's collaborate to drive positive change with data-driven solutions.
